## 📋 DOSING ACCURACY PATTERNS

### Q1: Are certain dosing stations consistently problematic?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Station Performance Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ YES - D03 (38.6% failure rate) and D07 (38.2% failure rate) are consistently worst  
**Evidence:** Statistical significance testing (t=3.02, p<0.01)

### Q2: How do dosing errors contribute to failures? (Think beyond simple totals)
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Station Performance Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ Strong correlation: r=0.921 between station error rates and failure rates  
**Beyond totals:** Error variability (std) matters more than magnitude

### Q3: Is it the magnitude of errors or their distribution that matters?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Error Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ DISTRIBUTION matters more - stations with high variability have higher failures  
**Evidence:** CV analysis shows D03 CV: 11.6, D07 CV: 14.8

### Q4: Are there patterns in which ingredients are affected?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Station Bias Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ YES - Systematic over-dosing bias in worst stations (D03: +0.76, D07: +0.68)  
**Pattern:** Over-dosing correlates with higher failure rates

## 🧪 RECIPE COMPLEXITY IMPACT

### Q5: How does ingredient count affect pass rates?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Recipe Complexity Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ Clear inverse relationship: More ingredients = higher failure rates  
**Evidence:** Simple (≤15): 28.9% vs Complex (>15): 41.6% failure rates

### Q6: What's the failure rate for simple vs. complex recipes?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Recipe Complexity Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ Simple (≤15 ingredients): 28.9% failure rate (4,551 batches)  
**Answer:** ✅ Complex (>15 ingredients): 41.6% failure rate (1,949 batches)

### Q7: Is there a specific complexity threshold where quality degrades?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Recipe Complexity Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ YES - 15 ingredients is the critical threshold  
**Evidence:** Statistical significance: χ²=99.3, p=2.16e-23

## 🌡️ TEMPERATURE EFFECTS

### Q8: What's the optimal temperature range for production?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Temperature Control Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ 20-25°C is the optimal range  
**Evidence:** Optimal range: 28.9% failure rate (4,144 batches)

### Q9: How do deviations from optimal impact quality?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Temperature Control Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ Significant impact: 10.7% increase in failures  
**Evidence:** Suboptimal temperatures: 39.5% failure rate

### Q10: Are extreme temperatures equally problematic in both directions?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Temperature Direction Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ NO - Cold temperatures are worse than hot  
**Evidence:** Cold (<20°C): 47.3% vs Hot (>25°C): 42.6% failure rate

## ⚙️ STATION PERFORMANCE

### Q11: Which dosing stations are most problematic?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Station Performance Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ D03 (38.6% failure rate) and D07 (38.2% failure rate)  
**Evidence:** Statistical evidence: Significantly worse than best performers

### Q12: Do certain stations show systematic bias (over/under dosing)?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Station Bias Analysis  
**Answer:** ✅ YES - Worst stations show over-dosing bias  
**Evidence:** D03: +0.76 systematic over-dosing bias, D07: +0.68 systematic over-dosing bias

### Q13: Has station performance degraded over time?
**Location:** Part 2.1 - Time-based Performance Trends  
**Answer:** ✅ YES - D07 shows significant degradation (+3.4% over the year)  
**Evidence:** D07 trend: 32.5% → 35.9% (+3.4%)
