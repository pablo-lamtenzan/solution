# Paint Manufacturing Quality Crisis Analysis

A comprehensive data science analysis of paint production quality failures using first principles and systems thinking methodologies.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a critical quality crisis where paint production failure rates increased from 1% to 33% after automation implementation. Using first principles decomposition and systems thinking, we identified three key root causes and developed actionable recommendations with quantified business impact.

## Key Findings

✅ **Recipe Complexity Threshold**: >15 ingredients show 41.6% vs 28.9% failure rate (12.7% improvement potential)
✅ **Temperature Control**: Optimal 20-25°C range shows 28.9% vs 39.5% failure outside range (10.6% improvement potential)
✅ **Station Performance**: Stations D03 & D07 show systematic calibration drift requiring immediate maintenance
✅ **Systems Interactions**: Multiplicative effects when risk factors combine (Cold + Complex = 51.9% failure rate)
✅ **Predictive Model**: ROC-AUC 0.61 validating root cause analysis
✅ **Business Impact**: $45,000 daily savings potential through systematic improvements

## Analysis Methodology

### First Principles Decomposition
1. **Dosing Accuracy**: Target vs actual amount analysis revealing systematic errors
2. **Recipe Complexity**: Ingredient count impact on failure rates with clear threshold effects
3. **Temperature Control**: Facility temperature correlation with quality outcomes
4. **Station Performance**: Individual dosing station bias and error patterns

### Systems Thinking Analysis
1. **Interaction Effects**: How factors multiply rather than add (Temperature × Complexity)
2. **Feedback Loops**: Station degradation patterns over time
3. **Emergent Properties**: System-level behaviors not visible in individual components

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync --dev
   ```

2. **Run complete analysis**:
   ```bash
   uv run python src/paint_analysis.py
   ```

3. **Generate visualizations**:
   ```bash
   uv run python src/visualization_generator.py
   ```

4. **View results**:
   - Executive Summary: `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
   - Visualizations: `visualizations/` directory
   - Decision Log: `DECISION_LOG.md`
